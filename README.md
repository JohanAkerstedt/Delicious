# Delicious

Share your recipes and version control your recipes.  

I suspect most of the practical version control will be focused on cakes.  

But other recipes are welcome, particularly if they are excellent and take almost no time to prepare.

Share your tips and tricks! We like efficiency.  

You can also add conversion, cooking time estimators scripts if you want â€¦  

You are also most welcome to use this repository as a training tool to learn git.
